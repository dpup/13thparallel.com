<h1>Coding For Portability, Part 1</h1>
<p class="author">By Tom Trenka, March 2002</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So...you've been playing around with DHTML for a while now, written your own 
site using DHTML libraries that you've downloaded from the web, and now you're 
thinking about writing your own.&nbsp; 
You've looked at a lot of sources, and think you've got a good idea of what you 
want to do, how you're going to structure it, and more...</p>
<p>So you happily start coding away.&nbsp; You write your own wrappers for the 
DOM functions, create another browser detection script, create your own methods 
for animation, your own event handlers, blah blah blah ;).&nbsp;
You've got it all together, you've debugged it as much as you can, and your site 
is about to be launched.</p>
<p>But wait!  Another DHTML dude has just released this widget that you think is 
SO cool, you gotta have it!&nbsp;
You grab the code, go to incorporate it into your site, and suddenly....everything 
breaks!&nbsp;
What gives?</p>

<h2>The problem with most DHTML APIs</h2>
<p>You have just fallen victim to one of the biggest problems I see in JavaScript coding
today - <strong>the lack of containment</strong>.&nbsp; There are a lot of great pieces of code 
out there, but most of them fail to take into account the idea that someone might want 
to use it, and have a hell of a time integrating it into their own libraries.&nbsp;
Some APIs (such as the current incarnation of the DynAPI) try to handle it by insisting 
that you use the DynAPI to do your work (as opposed to writing your own and making it 
work side-by-side); some release their code to the public without ever thinking that 
you might want to use it within your own framework, and more.</p>
<p>There are several things that you can do to help avoid these situations.&nbsp;
I'm going to talk about some of them; if you think of some that I've missed, let me
know - you can post messages to the 13th Forums, which I read frequently :)</p>
<p>But before I get into some of the techniques you can use to avoid "JS Conflict", let's 
review some of the basics of the language first.  Those of you who know this already can 
skip this part (but you might find out something you missed)...</p>

<h2>Back to the Basics</h2>
<h3>Variable Scope</h3>
<p>To really understand why you can get code conflicts, you need to understand how 
scoping works in JavaScript.&nbsp;
Scoping is a term used to describe the execution space in which a variable is defined 
and evaluated.  For instance, if we write a piece of code that looks like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
  var x = 0 ;
  var object = {
    x : 2 ,
    anotherObject : { x : 8 }
  } ;  
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>You'll notice that the variable <strong>x</strong> appears three times: once in <em>global</em> 
scope, once in the scope of the object <em>object</em>, and once in the scope of 
<em>object.anotherObject</em>.  
Although the variable is named the same thing, Javascript considers it to be three 
different variables.</p>
<p>What is the global scope, then?  Well, the global scope is the main "sandbox" the 
program is actually running in.  For most of you, this means the browser <strong>window</strong> 
object.</p>
<p>This is <em>very</em> important to know.  Because almost everything in Javascript is 
an object (except for the simple data types, which themselves have object
equivalents), <em>any time you create an object in JavaScript, it is added to the window 
(global) scope</em>.  Including functions!  So if you turn around and write something 
like this:</p>
<pre>function myFunction() {
  return &quot;This is my function&quot; ;
}</pre>
<p>what you are in reality doing is this:</p>
<pre>function window.myFunction() {
  return &quot;This is my function&quot; ;
}</pre>
<p>Try it out. If you call myFunction(), or you call window.myFunction(), you will get 
the same results.  Isn't that handy to know!</p>
<p>So, What's the problem then? Well, as far as I've seen, most of the DHTML code 
available on the Web is written using the global namespace (which is somewhat a synonym 
of scope).  This means that if you've written 500K of JavaScript, odds are you've 
defined a <em>lot</em> of variables within the global namespace.  (Remember, every 
time you create a function, you're creating a new variable!)</p>

<h3>Emulating Class-based OOP</h3>
<p>How do we get around this problem?  It turns out that JavaScript allows you to 
create your own objects.  There are two ways of doing this: the first, and probably 
the most commonly seen, is by using the <code>function</code> keyword in conjunction 
with <code>this</code> and <code>prototype</code>:</p> 
<pre>function myClass(id,title) {
  this.id = id ;
  this.title = title ;
}
myClass.prototype.getId = function() {
  return this.id ;
}
...etc...</pre>
<p>What you are doing here is creating the JavaScript equivalent of a <strong><em>class</em></strong>.  
I could use this function to return to my code a new <em>instance</em> of <code>myClass</code>, 
by using the <code>new</code> keyword:</p>
<pre>var test = new myClass('test','This is a test');</pre>
<p>which is great! Now I can use the power of Object-Oriented Programming by 
modeling my "problems" using bonafide objects!</p>

<h4>Class Modifiers in JavaScript</h4>
<p>Wait a minute - in a strongly-typed language, we have object modifiers like 
<code>public</code>,
<code>private</code>, or <code>static</code>.  What do these words do, and what 
do they mean?</p>
<p>Each of these words define some sort of accessibility to the object in question. 
<code>public</code> and <code>private</code> usually make the "class" definition either 
available or not available to code outside of the containing scope.  So in true OOP, 
if you're writing a class that you want the world to use, you would define it as 
<code>public</code>; if you didn't want the world to see it, you'd define it as 
<code>private</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <strong>all</strong> objects in JavaScript are considered <code>public</code>. 
This means that no matter what you do, a smart user will always be able to access 
any property or method you've defined in your API.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean they <em>know</em> all the properties and methods, though....</p>
<p>What about the <code>static</code> keyword?  In normal OOP, a <code>static</code> 
object is one that is
instantiated immediately, and cannot be created through the use of the <code>new</code> 
keyword.  This holds somewhat true for JavaScript, as
well-although not in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>Two examples of static objects present in the core JavaScript language are the 
<strong>Date</strong> and <strong>Math</strong> objects (the Date object is actually both static and public; 
you can instantiate new Dates, but you can also call static methods of the Date object).</p>

<h4>More on Static Objects and Properties</h4>
<p>How can this work for you?  You might have seen, in some of the examples out there, 
code that looks like this:</p>
<pre>function myClass(title) {
  this.id = 'myClass-' + <strong>myClass.Count++</strong> ;
  this.title = title ;
}
<strong>myClass.Count = 0 ;</strong>
myClass.prototype.getTitle = function() {
  return this.title;
} ;
...etc...</pre>
<p>The property <strong>Count</strong>, which is added directly to the <code>myClass</code> 
object, is being created as a <em>static</em> property.  This means that even though 
you might instantiate new <code>myClass</code> objects (which are in fact new Objects), 
the <code>Count</code> property remains with the original object you've created 
(which is <code>myClass</code>).  This property is only created once (as is the 
object <code>myClass</code>), and so maintains a single
integer - regardless of how many instances of <code>myClass</code> you create.  
In this case, the <code>Count</code> property is considered <strong>static</strong>.</p>
<p>(This technique is very handy for uniquely identifying instances of a particular 
class.)</p>
<h3>Making Static "Classes"</h3>
<p>Ok, back to the original point.  We've seen one way of creating objects, by 
using <code>function</code>, <code>this</code>, and <code>prototype</code>.  
This method is handy for emulating a Class-based OOP structure.</p>
<p>What if we only want one instance of an object, though?  It turns out there's 
another way of creating objects.  This can be written in one of two ways:</p>
<pre><em>Method One: C-Style syntax</em>
var myObject = {
	property : value ,
	property : value ,
	property : value 
}

<em>Method Two: using <strong>new</strong></em>
var myObject = new Object() ;
myObject.property = value ;
myObject['property'] = value ;

<em>Combining the two</em>
var myObject = {} ;
myObject.property = value ;
myObject['property'] = value ;

...etc...</pre>
<p>Both methods result in the same thing, so which one you use is up to you.  My
 preference is the first method ;)...Notice the use of colons in place of the equal 
 sign, and the use of commas in place of semi-colons...</p>
<p>Although you can instantiate new versions of objects defined by this method, you 
should only use this method of definition if you only want one instance of the object 
in your code.  It is slightly more efficient, and helps to clarify your code for both 
yourself and others.</p>


<h2>Isolating your code through Namespaces</h2>
<p>Now that we have the background, we can address the original problem: preventing 
"JS Conflict" between your code and someone else's code.  To do this, we take more 
hints from true OOP languages: we create a set of <strong>namespaces</strong>, and place our 
code inside of them.</p>
<p>What's a namespace?  A namespace is a device used by more robust OOP languages that 
sets up the scope of the objects within the namespace.  In other words, it is an additional 
level of scoping.  For instance, in C# (the new .NET language), I could isolate my code 
from all of the other code by writing something like this:</p>
<pre>public namespace TomsCode {
	public class myClass {
		...put stuff here...
	}
}</pre>
<p>Now, in order to get to <code>myClass</code>, I would have to qualify it using 
the namespace <code>TomsCode</code>.  Without that qualification, the compiler doesn't 
know what <code>myClass</code> means, and it barfs.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, you can emulate this functionality by using static objects as 
namespaces.  For instance:</p>
<pre>var TomsCode = {} ;
TomsCode.myClass = function (title) {
  this.id = 'myClass-'+TomsCode.myClass.Count++;
  this.title = title ;
}
TomsCode.myClass.Count = 0 ;
TomsCode.myClass.prototype.getTitle=function(){
  return this.title ;
} ;</pre>
<p>Notice something else: I used dot notation within the function name itself.  
This is perfectly legal in JavaScript, and you can go as far as you want with it!</p>
<p>When creating a namespace, you should use the conventions that Sun put forth for 
namespacing in Java:  start with your domain name (or something very similar), and 
go from there.  For instance:</p>
<pre>var org = {} ;
org.ThirteenthParallel = {} ;
org.ThirteenthParallel.Columns = {} ;
etc.</pre>
<p>This way you are (almost) assured that your namespace is unique...and you get 
(unless you're dealing with a very sharp coder) to keep credit of your library, 
which is becoming a big problem nowadays.</p>
<p>What if your domain name is really long (see the above example)?  Well, I know 
most of you DHTMLer are pretty lazy ;), so here's another factoid of JavaScript:  
<em>all objects are passed by reference</em>.  So if you don't feel like typing the 
full name all the time, you can simply assign an alias like this:</p>
<pre>var org = {} ;
org.ThirteenthParallel = {} ;

//Here's the alias
var _13th = org.ThirteenthParallel ;

_13th.Columns = {} ;
...etc...</pre>
<p>(This site's domain name presents a problem-it begins with a number, which is 
not allowed as a variable name in JavaScript...we get around it by beginning 
with an underscore :)</p>

<h3>Making sure the namespace exists</h3>
<p>Last problem: your API is split into a number of different files.  How do 
you know if the namespace has been created or not?</p>
<p>This one is fairly easy: you test for it's existence in the beginning of 
each file, and if it doesn't exist, you create it:</p>
<pre>if (!org) {
  var org = {} ;
  org.ThirteenthParallel = {} ;
} else {
  if (!org.ThirteenthParallel)
    org.ThirteenthParallel = {} ;
}
..etc...</pre>
<p>By the way, all of this would work in older versions of JavaScript too!</p>

<h2>Conclusion?</h2>
<p>I've introduced you to some of the basics of the JavaScript language, and 
shown you how you can emulate some of the more powerful features of a truly 
robust OOP through careful understanding of variable scope and object handling.  
So, for all of you API wanna-bees out there, I have one piece of
advice - <strong>use the namespacing</strong>! (I'm gettin' tired of rewriting all of your code... ;D )</p>
<p>Well, I'm pressed for time, so that's all for now....tune in next month as.... ;)</p>
