<h1>Column Script</h1>
<p class="author">By Michael van Ouwerkerk</p>

<p>The column script can be used to split an amount of text or html into an array 
of fragments that fit in the desired width and height. The effect is that you can now 
let your text flow from one column into the next, as if you were laying out an article 
for a newspaper or magazine.
</p>

<p>Dan first came up with the crazy proto version of this script, I took it from there 
to the most incredibly glorious and ravenous computing engine it is now.
</p>

<h2>Using the column script</h2>

<p>To use the column script, all you need to do is include the script on the page, 
and add this div, which is used by the script:<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;div id="divSizer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code><br />
<br />
Then you can call the splitText method with three arguments:<br />
<br />
<code>Columns.splitText(text, width, height)</code><br />
<br />
The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> arguments specify the maximum size 
the blocks of text may have. The <code>text</code> argument is the string of text 
or html that you wish to split.
</p>

<p>If you wish to use html strings, it&#8217;s recommended to use validated 
<strong>xhtml</strong> with correctly nested and closed tags. The unclosed tags 
that were legal in html 4.01 could wreak havoc on your pages. (if you&#8217;re not 
sure how to get started with xhtml, check out the introduction to using xhtml in 
the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/styleguide/" class="external">styleguide</a> of the 
New York Public Library)
</p>

<p>The splitText method then returns an array that contains the snugly fitting strings 
of text. If the browser does not support <code>document.getElementById</code> or 
<code>innerHTML</code> or cannot find divSizer, the splitText method will return 
<code>null</code>.<br />
<br />
<a href="example1.html">Example 
1</a>: shows how to use the splitText method, and a simple way of using the array 
returned by splitText. The text in the example was taken from the w3c CSS2 specification.
</p>


<h2>Extra features</h2>

<p>There is one extra thing you can do with this script. As you may have noticed on 
this site, in not every column the text runs all the way to the bottom. That&#8217;s 
because we&#8217;ve used a tag with a specific class that is automatically recognized 
and removed by the script. By including the following <code>span</code> tag in the 
text, you can force content following it to continue in the next column:<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;span class="colbreak"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code><br />
<br />
The colbreak class does not need to have any associated stylerules in a stylesheet, 
but we have given it absolute positioning and made it invisible. This was done to 
ensure the tag interferes as little as possible with the text, even when a browser 
has to display the unscripted version of the same document. 
</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Since this is a component article and not a tutorial, I won&#8217;t tell you much 
more about how the script works internally. However, there are some interesting 
things inside like a basic html parser and a number of array prototype functions. 
There are plenty of comments in the code, so go ahead and see what you can learn 
from it. One last thing: the <a href="lib_columns.js">lib_columns.js</a> file.
